 * Title: Egg Drop
 * Author: Sam Gavis-Hughson
 * Date: 11/28/2017
 * 
 * Consider dropping eggs off of a building. If you drop an egg from the Xth 
 * floor and it breaks, then you know for all eggs dropped from floor X or above,
 * they will break. Similarly, if you drop an egg from floor X and it doesn't 
 * break, no egg will break when dropped from floors 1 through X. Given a building 
 * with N floors and E eggs, find the minimum number of drops needed to determine 
 * the maximum floor that you can drop an egg from without it breaking.
 * 
 * eg.
 * 
 * eggs = 1
 * floors = 10
 * eggDrop(eggs, floors) = 10 
 * If you only have one egg, you need to try every floor from 1 to floors.
 * 
 * eggs = 2
 * floors = 10
 * eggDrop(eggs, floors) = 4
 * Drop the egg from the 4th floor, then the 7th, then the 10th. Each time, if 
 * the egg breaks, go to one above the previous test and progress up linearly.
 * 
 * Execution: javac EggDrop.java && java EggDrop
